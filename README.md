# TeknoVault Sound Integration for REMIX.AI

This document provides an overview of the TeknoVault sound integration implementation for REMIX.AI.

## Overview

The TeknoVault sound integration enables the core functionality of REMIX.AI: generating 64-sequence music with Claude using TeknoVault sound packs. This implementation includes:

1. **TeknoVaultService** - A service for managing sound packs, including loading, playing, and releasing sound samples
2. **ClaudeSoundDeploymentService** - A service that integrates Claude AI with TeknoVault sounds, generating 64-step beat patterns
3. **BeatVisualizer** - A component for visualizing and interacting with the 64-step beat patterns
4. **AudioEngine** - A component that handles playback of the beat patterns with BPM control
5. **ConversationalBeatCreator** - A component that combines the conversational interface with the beat creation functionality
6. **MainScreen** - A component that integrates all components into a cohesive UI

## Implementation Details

### TeknoVaultService

The TeknoVaultService manages sound packs and samples, providing methods for:
- Loading and initializing sound packs
- Retrieving sound packs and samples by category
- Loading and playing sound samples
- Releasing samples to free memory

### ClaudeSoundDeploymentService

The ClaudeSoundDeploymentService integrates Claude AI with the TeknoVault sounds, providing:
- Generation of 64-step beat patterns based on natural language prompts
- Modification of existing beats based on user feedback
- Structured explanation of musical decisions

### BeatVisualizer

The BeatVisualizer component visualizes the 64-step patterns, allowing users to:
- See the active steps for each instrument
- Toggle steps on/off
- View Claude's explanation of the beat

### AudioEngine

The AudioEngine component handles playback of the beat patterns, providing:
- Real-time playback of the 64-step patterns
- BPM control
- Step sequencing

### ConversationalBeatCreator

The ConversationalBeatCreator component combines the conversational interface with the beat creation functionality, allowing users to:
- Describe the beat they want to create in natural language
- Receive a generated beat from Claude
- Provide feedback to modify the beat
- View and interact with the generated beat

### MainScreen

The MainScreen component integrates all components into a cohesive UI, providing:
- Tab-based navigation between create and library screens
- Integration of the ConversationalBeatCreator component
